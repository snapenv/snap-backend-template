This is an open-source project and we welcome contributions.

## üë©‚Äçüíª How to contribute

Please follow the [fork and pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) workflow:

- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch for your feature.
- Add your feature or improvement.
- Send a pull request.
- We appreciate your support & input!

-----------------------
Contribution guidelines
-----------------------

Please:

1. Keep your commits modular
2. Add descriptive commit messages
3. Use conventional commits
4. Attach a PR to an issue if applicable
5. Ensure all new features have tests
6. Add documentation for new features

## Project setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment:
```sh
poetry install
```
   - This setup will:
     - Create a `.venv` virtual environment in the current directory.
     - Install the required packages.
     - Install the `snap-backend-template` package in editable mode.
3. Activate the virtual environment:
```sh
poetry shell
```
4. Test that the Python development environment is working:
```sh
ENVIRONMENT=dev poe test
```
- This setup will:
    - Use `dev.env` file as source of settings for the API server.
    - Starts a FastAPI server at `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.
    - Install the `snap-backend-template` package in editable mode.
- And open [localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) in your browser.

## Developing using Docker

To serve this app, run:

```sh
docker compose --profile app up -d
```

and open [localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) in your browser.

Within the Dev Container this is equivalent to:

```sh
ENVIRONMENT=dev poe api --dev
```

To stop, run:

```sh
docker compose --profile app down
```

| :boom: About env configuration |
|:-------------------------------|
| You can choose wich env file to use when running the app using the **ENVIRONMENT** env variable. If you set **ENVIRONMENT=dev** the app will read the `dev.env` file. If **ENVIRONMENT** is not set, the app will use the `.env` file. Off course, you can set all needed variables manually in the envionroment of your shell. |

## Formatting and validation

Ensure your code meets our quality standards by running the appropriate formatting and validation script before submitting a pull request:
   - `poe lint`
   - `ENVIRONMENT=dev poe test`
These scripts will perform code formatting with `ruff`, static type checks with `mypy`, and run unit tests with `pytest`.

<summary>Developing</summary>

- This project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard to automate [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and [Keep A Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) with [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen).
- Run `poe` from within the development environment to print a list of [Poe the Poet](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet) tasks available to run on this project.
- Run `poetry add {package}` from within the development environment to install a run time dependency and add it to `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`. Add `--group test` or `--group dev` to install a CI or development dependency, respectively.
- Run `poetry update` from within the development environment to upgrade all dependencies to the latest versions allowed by `pyproject.toml`.
- Run `poe docs`, `poe lint` and `ENVIRONMENT=dev poe test` before any commit, or your git push can fail. `poe docs` generate any new documentation for changes/additions in the python modules.
- Run `cz --name cz_gitmoji commit` so commit files using conventional commits with emojis.
- Run `cz bump` to bump the app's version, update the `CHANGELOG.md`, and create a git tag.
- Run `git push --tags` to push the new tag to github.
